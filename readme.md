# IS 452: Foundations of Information Processing - Fall 2019 

A public repo for the Fall 2019 IS452 lecture notes

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/elliewix/IS-452-Fall2018/master) (this is currently for the Fall 18 run until I fix the binder thing)

## Status

These are just about stable at this point.  Lecture content is reviewed during that week for class, and updated as needed.  But no major revisons are planned at this time.

## About

This is the repo for the IS452 class materials that I can make public, but mainly for the notebooks containing my lecture notes and occasionaly slides.  This doesn't contain everything for the class.
