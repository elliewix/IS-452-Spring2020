    "\n",
    "## Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the action driven in Python is done so by loops.  These things tell the program to repeat stuff.  Having a computer repeat a calculation or just keep trying something through a series of values is the power of computing.  We're going to be focused on looping through a set of known values.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're going to use for loops in nearly every Python program that you write for this class. Sometimes these for loops will look really similar, but you'll be using them for very different purposes.  **This is one of the most challenging aspects of the first month of this class.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specific types of this loop\n",
    "\n",
    "While there is a single syntax rule for `for` loop, there are many types.  We're going to start off with the three core patterns.  We'll learn more patterns as we move forward, but all of those are tweaks or expansions off of one of these three core patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three kinds of loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. repeat a task some arbitrary number of times\n",
    "    * your input is the number of times\n",
    "2. unpack some sequence of content and loop over those elements one at a time\n",
    "    * your input is the sequence, python will unpack it for you\n",
    "3. loop over something for the purposes of looking up another thing\n",
    "    * this one is strange, where you provide the sequence of items that represent the lookup key for another item.  These keys may be just numbers counting up, or they may be other kinds of content in a sequence (such as letters or words).\n",
    "\n",
    "These three uses will have a very similar syntax and can be difficult to tell the difference between.  For the sake of names, let's call them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. a range loop\n",
    "2. an unpacking loop\n",
    "3. a reference loop\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to explore and reinforce our understanding of data types and other stuff as we play with loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you'll need to mix and match these.  For example, the reference loop will often start off life as a range loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core syntax reference \n",
    "\n",
    "What does this for loop look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for iterable_variable in sequence:\n",
    "    do this stuff\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will loop over the `sequence` you provide, unpacking each value into the `iterable_variable`.  This variable will hold an individual value, one at a time, for each loop through.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's give names to all of these things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* declared and opened with a `for` keyword\n",
    "* a sequence that is being iterated over\n",
    "* an iterable variable to hold the variable contents of the sequence during each loop\n",
    "* white space (the tab) that defines where the executable code lives\n",
    "* the code to be executed each loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important notes:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* the iterable variable name can be literally any valid variable name and does not need to be declared previously\n",
    "* the colon at the end of the `for` line block is required and indicates that the declaration line is done\n",
    "* the `in` keyword separates the iterable variable name from the sequence\n",
    "* this case has the sequence literal in the declaration line, but could also be a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a sequence?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a good question with a weird answer.  Sequences are data types in Python that internally support sequencing.  That is, you can ask it \"what's next?\" and it can give you an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things aren't sequences.  Such as numbers (`int`s and `float`s).  You can try asking the number 1 \"what's next?\" but it doesn't know.  Are you counting by 1?  Are you counting by -1? Are you counting by .1?  The question is too ambiguous.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Some things are sequences.  Let's look at a word:  `\"hello\"`.  If I ask this word \"What's next?\" I'll be told the individual letters, getting one at a time during the loop.  The iterable variable will hold those values in succession.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on the iterable variable\n",
    "\n",
    "You can give this variable any name you want (but following the standard variable name rules), and it doesn't need to exist before.  It will feel strange, that you are typing in this variable to be used that doesn't yet have a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The for loop takes care of it for you.  It will make all the assignment statements for that sequence for you to that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it will persist after the for loop has completed! \n",
    "\n",
    "More on this as we progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up a for loop\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three steps for setting up a for loop.  We'll be going through all of these in much more detail as we work through examples. This section is just to set up your thought process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Determine what kind of pattern you'll be executing.  \n",
    "    * This is a thinking stage, where you need to think through what kind of pattern will move your program forward.\n",
    "2.  Identify your sequence.\n",
    "    * Once you know the kind of pattern you want, this will help you determine the kind of sequence.  There are times when the sequence will be very clear to you, and others where you'll be crafting one (for example in a reference loop) to generate the values you need.\n",
    "3.  Give your iterable variable a good name.\n",
    "    * You can technically call it `kitten`, but that isn't helpful.  Think about what it is and try to name it, being sure that you are matching the plural correctly.  For example, if you are working over a sequence of numbers, you might want to call it `num`, or if it's a string you could call it `character`.  \n",
    "    * Be very careful not to repeat any of your previous variable names, as their previous values will be erased for the iterable variable's value.  You may end up blowing away your data and weird things happen.  \n",
    "    * This name must also be different from the sequence's variable name (if it has one), because it might word and end up with really strange results.\n",
